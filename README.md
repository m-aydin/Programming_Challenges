# Programming Challenges
A collection of programming challenges I have done as an
assignment, packaged with a program to run them (launcher.py),
the booklet I did the challenges from is in the res folder, and
all rights reserved to the booklet's maker.

## Usage
Just run launcher.py, ensure you have a 3.0+ version of python and
it should work.
